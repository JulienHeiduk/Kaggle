#Help improve outcomes for shelter animals

Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.
Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.

We also believe this dataset can help us understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a new home. We encourage you to publish your insights on Scripts so they are publicly accessible.
